If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column.\n\n- COUNT() is an example of an aggregate function, which takes many values and returns one. (Other examples of aggregate functions include SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().\n\n### GROUP BY\nGROUP BY takes the name of one or more columns, and treats all rows with the same value in that column as a single group when you apply aggregate functions like COUNT().\n\n### Aliasing and other improvements\n- 为聚集函数出来的新的一行取个别名用AS\n- 如果不确定COUNT()里面什么参数，you can do COUNT(1) to count the rows in each group. Most people find it especially readable, because we know it's not focusing on other columns. It also scans less data than if supplied column names (making it faster and using less of your data access quota)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ORDER BY\nYou can reverse the order using the DESC argument\n\n### EXTRACT\nOften you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day.
