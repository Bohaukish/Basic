For example, to select just the third row of the `pets` table from the tutorial, we could use the query in the picture below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RccsXBr.png) \n\nYou can also use `%` as a \"wildcard\" for any number of characters. So you can also get the third row with:\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT * \n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` \n        WHERE Name LIKE '%ipl%'\n        \"\"\"\n```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### JOIN\n\n![double join](https://i.imgur.com/dYVwS4T.png)\n\n![double join](https://i.imgur.com/1Dvmg8S.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### INNER JOIN\n\nIn the query, ON determines which column in each table to use to combine the tables.\n\nThe type of JOIN we're using today is called an INNER JOIN. That means that a row will only be put in the final output table if the value in the columns you're using to combine them shows up in both the tables you're joining.\n\nHere's a reminder of what a **JOIN** looked like in the tutorial:\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name AS Owner_Name\n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p\n        INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o \n            ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nINNER JOIN 连接两个数据表的用法：\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM 表1 INNER JOIN 表2 ON 表1.字段号=表2.字段号\n```\n \n\nINNER JOIN 连接三个数据表的用法：\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM (表1 INNER JOIN 表2 ON 表1.字段号=表2.字段号) INNER JOIN 表3 ON 表1.字段号=表3.字段号\n\n ```\n\nINNER JOIN 连接四个数据表的用法：\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM ((表1 INNER JOIN 表2 ON 表1.字段号=表2.字段号) INNER JOIN 表3 ON 表1.字段号=表3.字段号) INNER JOIN\n\n表4 ON Member.字段号=表4.字段号\n```\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Write a new query that has a single row for each user who answered at least one question with a tag that includes the string \"bigquery\".
